## INTRODUCTION

MAME stands for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator, and lets you play arcade games from the past 30+ years on your iOS device.

More than 8000 games are supported, and the currently supported romsets are 0.250 (December 2022).

MAME for iOS was originally developed by David Valdeita (Seleuco), and is currently maintained and enhanced by dedicated enthusiasts (Yoshi Sugawara and Todd Laney).

Since the original version, a large number of features have been added, including:

- Metal Graphics Renderer
- Game Controller Support
- Touch Screen Lightgun Support
- Touch Screen Mouse Support
- On-screen Keyboard

See the official [web page](https://github.com/yoshisuga/MAME4iOS) for news, source code & additional information.

## CONTROLS

The emulator controls are the following ones:

**Virtual pad** Movement in pad, mouse and analog control of the four players.

**Buttons B,X,A,Y,L,R** Buttons A,B,C,D,E,F.

**Buttons START+COIN** (pressed simultaneously) Access to the MAME menu.

**Button COIN** Insert credits (UP+COIN = 2P credits, RIGHT+COIN = 3P credits, DOWN+COIN = 4P credits).

**Button START** Start (UP+START = 2P start, RIGHT+START = 3P start, DOWN+START = 4P start).

**Button EXIT** Exit to selection menu to select another game.

**Button MENU** Open $(TARGET) menu, global settings.

**NOTE** To type OK when MAME requires it, press LEFT and then RIGHT.

## GLOBAL OPTIONS

**FIlter** the method used to expand the emulator screen.
- **Nearest** Dont appy any filtering, aka `FatBits`
- **Linear**  Apply a smoothing image filter over the emulator screen.

**Skin** choose the artwork and layout of the onscreen controlls. 
- **Default** - the default $(TARGET) look.
- **Light Border** - Default + a bright thick border
- **Dark Border** - Default + a think dark border
- **Classic** - the old $(TARGET) look.

**Screen Shader**  effect to apply to the emulator screen. 
- **None** dont use any effect.
- **Default** use the default `simpleTron`.
- **simpleTron** simple CRT effect.
- **megaTron** more advanced CRT effect.
- **ulTron** even more advanced CRT effect.

**Vector Shader** effect to apply to vector games. 
- **None** dont use any effect.
- **Default** use the default `lineTron`.
- **lineTron** simple vector effect with fade out.

**Full Screen** Uses all available screen or shows the emulator windowed.

**Full Screen with Controller** automaticly enters Full Screen when a controler, keyboard, iCade is detected.

**Keep Aspect Ratio** 'Enabled' keeps the aspect ratio; 'Disabled' will use all available screen.

**Integer Scaling Only** 'Enabled' will only scale image by integer amounts.

**Change Current Layout** Changes the current touch controller current layout.

**Reset Current Layout to Default** Restores the current layout.

**Animated** Animates ON/OFF DPad/Stick. Disable to gain performance.

**Touch Type** Set the touch stick to works as analog stick, digital stick or dpad.

**Stick Type** Limits the joystick's range of motion: 8-way,4-way,2-way The most common reason to use a gate in an actual arcade setting is the retrofitting of an older machine that is not compatible with a new 8-way stick. A classic example of this is Pac-Man. The game was originally designed for a 4-way stick, and is programmed to respond only when a new input occurs. If the user is holding the stick in the down position, then suddenly makes a motion to move to the right, what often happens is that the stick first moves into the down-right diagonal, which the game does not recognize as new input since down is still being held. However, right is also now considered held, and when the user completes the motion to move right, it is also not a new input, and Pac-Man will still be moving down.

**Full Screen Buttons** Show 1-4/6 Buttons: Hide/show B/Y/A/X/L/R buttons if needed.

**Button A = B + X** Select it to use A button as B and X simultaneous press.

**Buttons Size** Lets you change the touch buttons size.

**Fullscreen Stick Size** Lets you change the stick size (not DPAD) on lanscape or portrait fullscreen mode.

**Nintendo Button Layout** if enabled the üÖê üÖë and üÖß üÖ® buttons will be swapped to match a Nintendo layout.  This option has no effect on a physical game controller.

**External Controller** Enable external controller: iCade, iControlPad as iCade mode or iMpulse.

**P4,P3,P2 as P1** Send Player 1 input data to Player2,3,4 so you can use the 2-4 players at the same time. Funny :). It makes some weird problems with some roms like D&D.

**Button B as Autofire** If enabled, press B to switch autofire on/off.

**DPAD Touch DZ** Enable/Disable a deadzone on DPAD touch center. It could be better for some games. Disable if you don't like it.

**Stick Touch DZ** Touch stick deadzone selector. Lower to gets more sensitivity.

**Sound** Enable or set the default sound rate for games.

**Cheats** Enables the reading of the cheat database, if present, and the Cheat menu in the user interface.

**Save Hiscores** If enabled, saves hiscores on some games not saving on NVRAM. It could cause problems with some games or save states.

**Show FPS** Shows ON/OFF fps.

**Force Pixel Aspect** Enable it to force pixel aspect ratio bypassing MAME video selection.

**Show Info/Warnings** Shows Game Info and any warnings when a game is selected.

## iCADE (or compatible)
<img src="iCadeControls.png" width=100%>

The best way to use iCade with $(TARGET) is in fullscreen portrait mode, hit the option button and choose options. The onscreen controls will fade out when you start using the iCade buttons. Tap the screen to get $(TARGET) menu.

If the iCade is off (the fake coin slot light is off) just hit an iCade button or move the joystick.(you must have paired the iCade via bluetooth before)

Thanks to Todd Laney for sending me patches, and Martijn Bosschaart who has supported me to get the iCade HW.

## iMpulse

$(TARGET) works correctly out of the box for iMpulse, also has built-in support for local multiplayer (TwiMpulse). Anayway, if you need to redefine second player buttons, you should press coin (left shoulder button) before so $(TARGET) initializes second iMpulse controller.

## XInput Controller

If you have an XInput compatible controller, use `Settings` > `Accessibility` > `Switch Control` > `Switches` > `Bluetooth Devices` to pair controller, then use as normal in $(TARGET).

## TV-OUT

To connect an iPad or iPhone to your TV or a projector, you can either use the Apple HDMI, Component AV Cable, Apple Composite AV Cable, Apple Dock Connector to VGA Adapter, or other compatible cable.

When the cable is connected to a TV or projector, $(TARGET) will automatically use it when playing a game.

## ROM INSTALLATION

use `Import...`, `Start Web Server`, or `Import from iCloud` from `$(TARGET)` `Settings` 


## MANUAL ROM INSTALLATION

Use the Files app to manually add ROM files to the `roms` folder in the $(TARGET) folder.

## $(TARGET) LICENSE

$(TARGET) is released under a dual-license (GPL / MAME license) of your choice. Under the GPL license in addition you have some extra rights granted by a special license exception which allow you to link the $(TARGET) GPL source with the not GPL MAME source. The exception also gives you the rights to eliminate it if you don't like it or if you want to include the $(TARGET) source in another GPL program. So, $(TARGET) is 100% GPL. You can more easily think at it as a sort of double license. A GPL or a GPL + exception. You have all the rights of the GPL, and, if you want, some others. The only limitation is for $(TARGET). $(TARGET) cannot include external GPL source without the explicit permission of the source copyright holder.
