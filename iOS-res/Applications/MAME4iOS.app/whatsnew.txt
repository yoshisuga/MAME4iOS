Source Changes
--------------
Added many instances of missing static and const qualifiers to MAME,
and disabled a fair chunk of dead code in konamiic.c.  [Atari Ace]

Confirmation (with frequency counter) of proper 68000 clock speeds (16
MHz) for Premier Soccer and Golfing Greats.  [Fabrizio Vasile]

[Dr. Decapitator]

C++-ified the debugger views. Split implementation of individual view
types out to separate files. Updated all callers. [Aaron Giles]

Changed emualloc to free resource pools from earliest to latest so
that early objects can safely clean up stuff they allocated. 
[Aaron Giles]

Changed device name from an overridable function to a parameter passed
to the device_config constructor. In situations where the proper name
is not known at construction time, a generic name can be specified and
then overridden later once the configuration is complete. [Aaron Giles]

Decapped 89C51 MCU in Real Battle Mahjong King [Dr. Decapitator, Guru]

metro.c: Added Puzzlet's MCU internal ROM. Zilog Z8 8-bit family MCU
requires a new CPU core to be written. [Dr. Decapitator]

Hooked up Renegade 68705 MCU [Phil Bennett, Dr. Decapitator]

Made redufo Artic version the parent and bootleg version a clone [hap]

 * Tagged kof2003h AES VERSION
 * Tagged the following sets as MVS AND AES VERSION: aodk, lbowling
 * Renamed P1 in sengoku3 to correct chip label
 * Marked v2 in strhoop BAD_DUMP
 * Marked P1 in flipshot BAD_DUMP
 * Identified kof98n as AES version, renamed to kof98h

 * Emulated IGS012 protection
 * Removed 149 rom patches

Hooked up Slap Fight/Alcon 68705 MCU [Phil Bennett, Dr. Decapitator]

Hooked up MCUs for Tough Turf (US) and Wrestle War; removed Wrestle
War MCU simulation. [Aaron Giles, Dr. Decapitator]

cps2.c: Correct the release order for the Xmen: Cota (Hispanic) sets
[gregf]

Made the machine_config a proper object. Added detokenize method to
this object which can be called multiple times to append new devices
after the initial machine configuration is set up. Updated member
variables to match new naming convention. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the running_machine to take a constructed machine_config
object in the constructor, instead of creating one itself, for
consistency. Also added machine->total_colors() as a shortcut to
machine->config->m_total_colors. [Aaron Giles]

firetrap.c: Added PCB documentation, corrected ROM names, corrected
clocks [Guru]

idsoccer: Improved DIP locations, confirmed MSM5205 clock
[Kevin Eshbach]

Fixed title screen colors in Bogey Manor
[Angelo Salese, Stefan Lindberg]

Modified way device_type constants are defined in order to get unidasm
compile [Miodrag Milanovic]

Changed autmoon (aristmk4) romload to proper crc/sha hashes.  The
submitted romset contained a 32kb (u87.bin) which actually appeared to
be an 8k overdumped. [Tafoid]

slapfght.c: Corrected rom names for the Slap Fight sets and added PCB
locations to any set where possible. Added Dipswitch locations to Slap
Fight.  Moved PCB information down to matching rom sets.
[Brian Troha, Guru]

Split mame.c into mame.c and machine.c, the latter containing the
running_machine definition and implementation. [Aaron Giles]

Moved global machine-level operations and accessors into methods on
the running_machine class. For the most part, this doesn't affect
drivers except for a few occasional bits: [Aaron Giles]

  mame_get_phase() == machine->phase() 
  add_reset_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_RESET, ...) 
  add_exit_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_EXIT, ...)
  mame_get_base_datetime() == machine->base_datetime()
  mame_get_current_datetime() == machine->current_datetime()

Cleaned up the region_info class, removing most global region
accessors except for memory_region() and memory_region_length().
Again, this doesn't generally affect drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Resurrect the old sampling profiler, and improve it to be useful:
[Aaron Giles]
 * always available now, just specify -profile <n> to enable it
 * supports stack walking to uniquely identify call chains; the <n>
    parameter to the -profile option specifies how deep to go
 * automatically turns off throttling and multithreading, and sets the
    number of processors available to 1 (since we only sample the main
    thread)
 * output now uses the common symbol lookup, which actually uses the
    PDB for MSVC builds and sym files for gcc builds
 * the top 30 unique call chains are output

Fix performance regression for PowerPC games. The timing made heavy
use of cpu_get_total_cycles() which is now slow. Better to use the
legacy_cpu_device directly and call device->total_cycles() which
avoids the dynamic_cast to find the execute interface from a generic
device. [Aaron Giles]

Added cycles_to_attotime() and attotime_to_cycles() which is more
often what is requested. (Clocks are the raw input clock, while cycles
are internal clock after dividers/multipliers.) [Aaron Giles]

Removed most other instances of cpu_get_total_cycles. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the following functions: [Aaron Giles]
  cpu_get_total_cycles()   == cpudevice->total_cycles()
  cpu_clocks_to_attotime() == cpudevice->cycles_to_attotime()
  cpu_attotime_to_clocks() == cpudevice->attotime_to_cycles()

Correct dipswitch location order in World Rally to match actual dips
as seen by the game / service menu. [Brian Troha]

namcos22.c: updated ridgerac, raveracw and acedrvrw to use keys
instead of dipswitches for shifters [Fabio Priuli]

Added COPX romloading for sets that didn't have it, marked as BAD_DUMP
until the assumption that they're the same is (un)confirmed. [hap]

Winmain cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * created dynamic_bind<> template class to handle dynamically binding
    to optionally-supported functions
 * wrapped stack walking code in a class
 * wrapped symbol lookup code in a class
 * added support for parsing objdump-produced symbol dumps which
    include non-global functions for much better stack dumps and
    profiling in gcc builds

Modified makefile for win32 targets to automatically run objdump
and produce a .sym file if SYMBOLS is enabled. [Aaron Giles]

Update cheat loading to support image devices (moved implementation
from MESS), use only CRC of first found image. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Removed cpu_get_sp(). [Aaron Giles]

Added overrides to fetch the execute, memory and state interfaces 
without doing a dynamic_cast<> to speed up common legacy operations.
[Aaron Giles]

Created CPU-specific device types for all CPUs, using new macros
DECLARE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE and DEFINE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE. Changed CPUs
to be their own device types, rather than all of type CPU with a
special internal subtype. Note that as part of this process I removed
the CPU_ prefix from the ALL-CAPS device name, so CPU_Z80 is just
plain old Z80 now. This required changing a couple of names like 8080
to I8080 so that there was an alphabetic first character. [Aaron Giles]

Hooked up Heavy Barrel I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator] 

[cb2001] added 2 new opcodes [robiza]

Hooked up Gondomania I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator]

Reimplemented Meikyuu Hunter G I8751 MCU according to schematics
[Bryan McPhail]

Software list update: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Software list xml files are now read in full such that information 
    for clone and parent sets is available.
 - Added validity check to check for existence of parent sets.

Imported image related utils from MESS into /lib/util [Miodrag Milanovic]

Improved video emulation in cb2001 [David Haywood]

Added support for Sega 317-5000 decryption (same as 315-5177). 
Reorganised decryption code. [Nicola Salmoria]

Moved debugging structure away from CPUs only and attached to all
devices. Debugger now creates one for each device. C++-ified most
debugger operations to hang off the debugging class, and updated
most callers. [Aaron Giles]

Got rid of cpu_count, cpu_first, cpu_next, etc. as they were badly 
broken. Also removed cpu_is_executing, cpu_is_suspended,
cpu_get_local_time, and cpu_abort_timeslice. [Aaron Giles]

Software list improvements: [Miodrag Milanovic]
 - Support for multiple software list per driver 
 - Added MDRV_SOFTWARE_LIST_COMPATIBLE_ADD for adding compatible 
    software lists (for documentation purposes) [Miodrag Milanovic]
 - listsoftware option now return only original software lists
 - UI is updated to enable mounting software items per device, it 
    will display only items from list that are for specific device
 - Separate compatible software lists in UI

Source Changes
--------------
A small update for the YM2610 core, which resets the PCM and Delta-T
memory regions when the chip is reset.  This is needed for MESS, where
being able to change the size and existence of the sample regions on
the Neo Geo AES is necessary for the sound to work right, especially
for games that don't have a specific Delta-T region.  [Barry Rodewald]

Increased number of coinslots to 12, and tilt inputs to 4, required by
in-progress gambling driver [David Haywood]

Fixed various hangs and NVRAM init in the Model 2 driver
[Angelo Salese]

Add partial decrypt function for vortex (0x0000-0x1FFF is decrypted
properly, 0x4000-0x5FFF is probably not), still much work to be done
especially regarding memory maps (which are affected by the epoxy
block address inverts as well). [Lord Nightmare, The Dumping Union]

Fixed a warning in Visual Studio 2010 that was introduced by a
previous commit.  [Oliver Stoneberg]

Added some missing static qualifiers to MAME.  Also, renamed some
generically named exports from segaic16.c.  [Atari Ace]

batsugun: fixed layer-layer priorities; sprite-sprite priorities are
wrong [robiza]

dogyuun: fixed layer-layer priorities; sprite priorities are wrong
[robiza]

hal21: cabinet DIPSW was reversed btlfield: DIAL was used instead of
rotary joystick [/SftiKDL0]

namconb1.c: Replaced sound data rom for the Point Blank sets that was
incorrectly dumped.  The new dump has been verified on 3 different
PCBs. [Guru, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

kongambl.c updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Mapped ROMs correctly to processors

 * Pregap and postgap information is now preserved in the format
 * Output of CDRDAO images is significantly improved
Existing CHD-CDs will continue to work fine and for data-only discs no
action needs to be taken.  For mixed data/audio discs (e.g. analog
573/Bemani games) they should be re-converted for better preservation.

kongambl: Support unpaged 056832 VRAM access [R. Belmont]

device. Update playch10 driver. [Couriersud]

Addd documentation about tms5110 prom interface used by bagman and
ad2083. [Couriersud]

SDLMAME now compiles against SDL 1.3 up to HG rev 4464. Everything
beyond that revision is completely broken since Sam ripped out
multi-keyboard and multi-mice support. Further information in
README_SDL13.txt [Couriersud]

Splitted the ST-V protection handlings by per-game [Angelo Salese]

Added proper RTC support to the ST-V driver [Angelo Salese]

Massive Space Invaders related comment update, documenting various
sets, and the various Taito PCBs used by Space Invaders/Tabletop
SI/Tabletop SI Color/Tabletop SI II/etc.
[Andrew Welburn, Lord Nightmare]

Hooked up color prom in Kick Boy [Angelo Salese]

Defined two new casting helpers: [Aaron Giles]

  downcast<type>(value) should be used for safe and efficient
  downcasting from a base class to a derived class. It wraps
  static_cast<> by adding an assert that a matching dynamic_cast<>
  returns the same result in debug builds.

  crosscast<type>(value) should be used for safe casting from one type
  to another in multiple inheritance scenarios. It compiles to a
  dynamic_cast<> plus an assert on the result. Since it does not
  optimize down to static_cast<>, you should prefer downcast<> over
  crosscast<> when you can.

Redefined running_device to be a proper C++ class (now called
device_t). Same for device_config (still called device_config). All
devices and device_configs must now be derived from these base
classes. This means each device type now has a pair of its own unique
classes that describe the device. Drivers are encouraged to use the
specific device types instead of the generic running_device or
device_t classes. Drivers that have a state class defined in their
header file are encouraged to use initializers off the constructor to
locate devices. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the following fields from the device and device configuration
classes as they never were necessary or provided any use: device
class, device family, source file, version, credits. [Aaron Giles]

Added templatized variant of machine->device() which performs a
downcast as part of the device fetch. Thus
machine->device<timer_device>("timer") will locate a device named
"timer", downcast it to a timer_device, and assert if the downcast
fails. [Aaron Giles]

Removed most publically accessible members of running_device/device_t
in favor of inline accessor functions. The only remaining public
member is machine. Thus all references to device->type are now
device->type(), etc. [Aaron Giles]

Created a number of device interface classes which are designed to be
mix- ins for the device classes, providing specific extended
functionality and information. There are standard interface classes
for sound, execution, state, nvram, memory, and disassembly. Devices
can opt into 0 or more of these classes. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the classic CPU device to a standard device that uses the
execution, state, memory, and disassembly interfaces. Used this new
class (cpu_device) to implement the existing CPU device interface. In
the future it will be possible to convert each CPU core to its own
device type, but for now they are still all CPU devices with a
cpu_type() that specifies exactly which kind of CPU. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new header devlegcy.h which wraps the old device interface
using some special template classes. To use these with an existing
device, simply remove from the device header the DEVICE_GET_INFO()
declaration and the #define mapping the ALL_CAPS name to the
DEVICE_GET_INFO. In their place #include "devlegcy.h" and use the
DECLARE_LEGACY_DEVICE() macro. In addition, there is a
DECLARE_LEGACY_SOUND_DEVICE() macro for wrapping existing sound
devices into new-style devices, and a DECLARE_LEGACY_NVRAM_DEVICE()
for wrapping NVRAM devices. Also moved the token and inline_config
members to the legacy device class, as these are not used in modern
devices. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the standard base devices (VIDEO_SCREEN, SPEAKER, and TIMER)
from legacy devices to the new C++ style. Also renamed VIDEO_SCREEN to
simply SCREEN. The various global functions that were previously used
to access information or modify the state of these devices are now
replaced by methods on the device classes. Specifically:

  video_screen_configure()             == screen->configure()
  video_screen_set_visarea()           == screen->set_visible_area()
  video_screen_update_partial()        == screen->update_partial()
  video_screen_update_now()            == screen->update_now()
  video_screen_get_vpos()              == screen->vpos()
  video_screen_get_hpos()              == screen->hpos()
  video_screen_get_vblank()            == screen->vblank()
  video_screen_get_hblank()            == screen->hblank()
  video_screen_get_width()             == screen->width()
  video_screen_get_height()            == screen->height()
  video_screen_get_visible_area()      == screen->visible_area()
  video_screen_get_time_until_pos()    == screen->time_until_pos()
  video_screen_get_time_until_vblank_start() ==
                               screen->time_until_vblank_start()
  video_screen_get_time_until_vblank_end() ==
                               screen->time_until_vblank_end() 
  video_screen_get_time_until_update() == 
                               screen->time_until_update() 
  video_screen_get_scan_period()       == screen->scan_period() 
  video_screen_get_frame_period()      == screen->frame_period() 
  video_screen_get_frame_number()      == screen->frame_number()

  timer_device_adjust_oneshot()        == timer->adjust()
  timer_device_adjust_periodic()       == timer->adjust()
  timer_device_reset()                 == timer->reset()
  timer_device_enable()                == timer->enable()
  timer_device_enabled()               == timer->enabled()
  timer_device_get_param()             == timer->param()
  timer_device_set_param()             == timer->set_param()
  timer_device_get_ptr()               == timer->get_ptr()
  timer_device_set_ptr()               == timer->set_ptr()
  timer_device_timeelapsed()           == timer->time_elapsed()
  timer_device_timeleft()              == timer->time_left()
  timer_device_starttime()             == timer->start_time()
  timer_device_firetime()              == timer->fire_time()

Updated all drivers that use the above functions to fetch the specific
device type (timer_device or screen_device) and call the appropriate
method. [Aaron Giles]

Changed machine->primary_screen and the 'screen' parameter to
VIDEO_UPDATE to specifically pass in a screen_device object.
[Aaron Giles]

Defined a new custom interface for the Z80 daisy chain. This interface
behaves like the standard interfaces, and can be added to any device
that implements the Z80 daisy chain behavior. Converted all existing
Z80 daisy chain devices to new-style devices that inherit this
interface. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the way CPU state tables are built up. Previously, these were
data structures defined by a CPU core which described all the
registers and how to output them. This functionality is now part of
the state interface and is implemented via the device_state_entry
class. Updated all CPU cores which were using the old data structure
to use the new form. The syntax is currently awkward, but will be
cleaner for CPUs that are native new devices. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the okim6295 and eeprom devices to the new model. These were
necessary because they both require multiple interfaces to operate and
it didn't make sense to create legacy device templates for these
single cases. (okim6295 needs the sound interface and the memory
interface, while eeprom requires both the nvram and memory
interfaces). [Aaron Giles]

Changed parameters in a few callback functions from pointers to
references in situations where they are guaranteed to never be NULL.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed MDRV_CPU_FLAGS() which was only used for disabling a CPU.
Changed it to MDRV_DEVICE_DISABLE() instead. Updated drivers.
[Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the token parsing for machine configurations. The core
parsing code knows how to create/replace/remove devices, but all
device token parsing is now handled in the device_config class, which
in turn will make use of any interface classes or device-specific
token handling for custom token processing. [Aaron Giles]

Moved many validity checks out of validity.c and into the device
interface classes. For example, address space validation is now part
of the memory interface class. [Aaron Giles]

Consolidated address space parameters (bus width, endianness, etc.)
into a single address_space_config class. Updated all code that
queried for address space parameters to use the new mechanism.
[Aaron Giles]

Boards [Andrew Welburn, Lord Nightmare]

Fixed priorities in Frog & Spiders [Angelo Salese]

Updated galivan.c with DIP LOCATIONS and verified setting via Service
Mode.  Added comments about missing text layer in Ninja Emaki and
flagged those sets with missing protection emulation.  [Tafoid]

Fix audio cpu banking in Raiden 2 (add a missing mirror to banking
register) [trap15, R. Belmont]

Corrected Raiden II audio banking - it's only at 401a [R. Belmont]

Flash: 4k sectors should erase in 1/8th the time of 64k. extend core
to support GBA chip types. [R.Belmont]

Clean up profiling flags in the makefile. Removed GPROF flag, it is
now just PROFILE. When enabled, automatically turn on basic symbols.
Also added new SYMLEVEL option to control the symbols level (defaults
to 2). [Aaron Giles]

Dumped internal ROM for Pinkiri 8 [Charles MacDonald]

Dumped internal ROM for Janshi [Charles MacDonald]

Rewrote Z180 cycle accounting to create a basis for more exact
internal I/O and timer operations as well as implementing interrupt
priorities. Removed unused BIG_SWITCH code as well. [Couriersud]

MPU4 Updates [James Wallace]:
 * Added trackball support
 * Fixed quiz game controls
 * Restructured AWP games' characteriser handling

Added photo y2k2 decryption table [iq132]

Added x/y boundary checking to ST-V bitmaps [Angelo Salese]

atarigx2.c: More rom name corrections as verified against a Moto
Frenzy Mini Deluxe PCB. Added ROM for the "Clarn" game link sub PCB.
[Charles MacDonald, P. Sealy, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union]

Added lfsr-driven starfield to 20pacgal. The general principle is
understood now but star set selection and the star drawing condition
are guesses. [Couriersud]

Moved global and static variables in driver galaga into a machine
class. Renamed some variables, e.g. galaga_videoram and bosco_videoram
to just videoram. [Couriersud]

Added a readyq callback to the TMS5220 interface. This is needed to
solve MT #3832. In zaccaria games, the intq and readyq are connected
to pia 6821 lines ca2 and cb1 which are edge driven. Just reading
readyq would miss to detect a state change if between reads readyq
went 0-1-0. Updated zaccaria.c and looping.c. Fixes MT #3832.
[Couriersud]

Reworked rendering in toaplan2 to render tilemaps / sprites in a
single pass, should be more accurate to hardware. Note, this further
breaks the mixing in Batsugun and Dogyuun because the previous hacks
can no longer work with the new rendering code. These games have been
demoted to NOT_WORKING status until a better solution is found; they
never worked properly anyway due to the extent of the video hacks
needed to support them [David Haywood]

documentation: Cleaned up company names [hap]

Added NSC800 CPU emulation to the Z80 core [Sandro Ronco]

Updated Legendary Wings with actual PCB speed readings.
